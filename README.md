## Charlie and the Search for Pepe Silvia
### A Ruby REPL Game

### Description

When assigned with the task of created a REPL game, the one idea that came to mind was to make a text adventure 
on one of my favorite TV shows, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

The object of the game is to find the answers as to why Pepe Silvia doesn't exist even though you keep recieving letters 
addressed to him. 

### Installation

No installation required. Just download the **pepe_silvia.rb** file.

### Usage

After downloading the file, run it from your Command Line using: 

```bash

ruby pepe_silvia.rb

```

## Please enjoy!
